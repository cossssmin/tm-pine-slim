# What's different?

This fork changes the grid system in Pine, from 12 to only 6 columns.

# Pine Slim - Email Framework

A modular and lightweight, responsive email framework, based on the [Pine Email Framework](https://thememountain.github.io/pine/) by  [ThemeMountain](http://thememountain.com/).

There is no build system. Just a grid, some CSS, a few design patterns, and some awesome components.
Simply copy HTML and stack grid elements in a default layout file, then add your own content inside them.

## Features

- Compatible with major email clients, thoroughly tested
- Responsive, 6 column grid
- Interactive components (hamburger menu, accordions)
- Facilitates Outlook background image support
- Mobile breakpoint column sizes and offsets
- Alignment and visibility helpers
- Reverse column stacking on mobile


## Documentation

Documentation for the 6 column grid is currently WiP.

You can view the documentation for the 12 column grid Pine Framework, at [thememountain.github.io/pine](https://thememountain.github.io/pine/)
